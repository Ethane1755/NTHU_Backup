【08】 The flux through one turn is ΦB = BA = Bl2
, so we can calculate the magnitude of the emf from
Faraday’s law. Lenz’s law: | | =∣−NdΦB/dt∣= Nl2dB/dt = (400)(0.50m)2[(1.8-1.6)/(5.0) (T/s)] =
(400)(0.50m)2(0.040T/s) = 4.0V. The magnitude of the current induced in the coil is I = | | / R = 4.0V / 8.0Ω =
0.50A.
【09】 Here f = 0.5 Hz; N =200, A = 0.100 m2 and B = 0.0100 T. × 2 × 3.14 × 0.500 = 0.628 V. The maximum voltage is 0.628 V.
ε = NBA (2 π f) = 200 × 0.0100 × 0.100
【11】 Reasoning: The rate at which the flux changes is dΦB/dt = B*d*dL/dt = B*d*v, since the only thing
changing is the length of the circuit, and ΔL/∆t = v. The current flowing in the circuit will be I = vBd/R.
Details of the calculation:
I = vBd/R. Therefore v = IR/(Bd) = 0.80 A*8.0 Ω/(1.5 T*1.8 m) = 2.4 m/s.
